## Richard &amp; Michael

## Summary
Data Lifecycle - Our project aligns well with the USGS Science Data Lifecycle Model. Its linear sequence of steps maps closely onto our workflow for managing hte NBA data.
We begin with planning where we define our research question and determine any ethcial and legal constraints. Then we acquire our salary and statistic datasets from Kaggle. After we process and clean the datasets normalizing variable and fixing inconsistencies. In the Analysis stage we do a regression analysis between performance metrics and salary answering our research questions. Then we generate visualizations that support our Question.
