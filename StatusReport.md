# Interim Status Report

## Overview
We are still on track with our original timeline and have had no difficulties so far. 

## Progress Report by Task
### Week 1: 
Completed everything in our Week 1 project plan. Finalized our Research Question of Which Player Stats affect the Salary of a Player the most? We confirmed both our Datasets from Kaggle Dataset 1 is [NBA Player Salaries (2000-2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratin21/nba-player-salaries-2000-2025) and Dataset 2 is [Historical NBA Player Stats Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flynn28/historical-nba-player-stats-database/data), identifying Key Variables of Points, Assists, Rebounds, Turnovers, Player, and Salary. The Script for our Data Acquisition and Integrity is in the file titled dataAcquisitionScript.py. The documentation is in the file titled dataAcquisitionDocumentation.md

### Week 2:
Before we begin loading and working with the data, we must first outline the ethical, legal, and policy constraints relevant to our project analyzing the correlation between NBA player salaries and performance. It is important that we adhere to the FAIR principles to create a reproducable and responsible data management lifecycle. 


Our 2 datasets are from Kaggle. Dataset 1 is [NBA Player Salaries (2000-2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratin21/nba-player-salaries-2000-2025), and has a CC0: Public Domain license, which is highly permissive. We are free to use, share, and build upon this data for any purpose, including this project, without restriction. No specific attribution is legally required, though it is good academic practice. Dataset 2 is [Historical NBA Player Stats Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flynn28/historical-nba-player-stats-database/data), and has a MIT License whose primary condition is that we must include the original copyright notice and the license text with any substantial portions of the "software" (which, in this context, applies to the dataset). We will fulfill this by including a copy of the MIT license in our project's documentation and repository.


As for Kaggle's terms of service, we will not host the raw .csv data files in our public GitHub repository. Instead, we will provide direct links to the Kaggle dataset pages and include our data acquisition scripts (e.g., Python scripts using the Kaggle API or manual download instructions) so that any third party can reproducibly acquire the same data. 


When handling data about real individuals, even public figures, we must consider the ethical implications. Although player salaries and performance statistics are public information, our analysis aggregates this data in ways that could be misinterpreted to pass judgment on a player's value. The primary risk is that our findings could be used to label specific players as "overpaid" or "underpaid," a conclusion that is both negative and reductionist given the inevitable limitations of any statistical model. To mitigate this, our project's goal is not to critique individual players but to identify statistical correlations between performance metrics and salary trends. All published analysis will focus on these aggregate trends, not the "worth" of players, and will include clear disclaimers about the model's limitations while avoiding subjective or inflammatory language. We must also consider the risk of misinterpretation, as it is connected to the potential for algorithmic and metric bias. Our research question relies on the assumption that the available metrics are fair and comprehensive. However, traditional box-score statistics like points and rebounds are known to favor offensive players over defensive specialists, and our analysis might reinforce existing biases in how player value is determined. We will explicitly document this as a potential source of bias and a limitation of our analysis.

We will primarily use CSV's and Files to facilitate Organization and Storage throughout our project. We will make sure to correclty name our files and clean our CSV's to create better readability. Our files will follow a strict naming strategy. we will use a descriptive title along with 'Script' for our scripts. We will also create separate scripts and documentation files. 

We finished up our Data Relation script, being stored in the file titled dataRelationScript.py, along with documentation in the file titled dataRelationDocumentation.md

### Week 3:
We finished creating our Data Integration script, being stored in the file title dataIntegrationScript.py, along with documenation in the file titled dataIntegrationDocumentation.md

### Week 4:
Not started.
### Week 5:
Not Started.
### Week 6:
Not Started

## Updated Timeline
Week 4 - 11/17-11/24. We will try to finish Week 4 and parts of Week 5 during this Week so we don't have to do much work over Thanksgiving break.
Week 5 - 11/24-11/31. Finish Week 5 over Thanksgiving Break.
Week 6 - 12/1-12/8. Finish up the Project before the deadline.

## Changes to Project
We didn't change our project from our Status Report as we didn't have any concerning comments. First of all Richard and I worked together on all of the project. We had a shared notebook where we did our code and shared our script on GitHub. We changed the way we did things where it was split up in weeks, instead we worked together and helped each other out. 

## Individual Contribution
Michael - We both talked about and agreed on the conceptual part of our project, research questions, variables, and storage techniques. I did the IntegrationScript and Documentation, as well as the Documentation for the other scripts. Along with this I helped out Richard with any questions he had along the way.
