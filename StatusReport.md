# Interim Status Report

## Overview

## Progress Report by Task
### Week 1: 
Completed everything in our Week 1 project plan. Finalized our Research Question of Which Player Stats affect the Salary of a Player the most? We confirmed both our Datasets from Kaggle and identified Key Variables of Points, Assists, Rebounds, Turnovers, Player, and Salary. The Script for our Data Acquisition and Integrity is in the file title dataAcquisitionScript.py.

### Week 2:
Before we begin loading and working with the data, we must first outline the ethical, legal, and policy constraints relevant to our project analyzing the correlation between NBA player salaries and performance. It is important that we adhere to the FAIR principles to create a reproducable and responsible data management lifecycle. 


Our 2 datasets are from Kaggle. Dataset 1 is [NBA Player Salaries (2000-2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratin21/nba-player-salaries-2000-2025), and has a CC0: Public Domain license, which is highly permissive. We are free to use, share, and build upon this data for any purpose, including this project, without restriction. No specific attribution is legally required, though it is good academic practice. Dataset 2 is [Historical NBA Player Stats Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flynn28/historical-nba-player-stats-database/data), and has a MIT License whose primary condition is that we must include the original copyright notice and the license text with any substantial portions of the "software" (which, in this context, applies to the dataset). We will fulfill this by including a copy of the MIT license in our project's documentation and repository.


As for Kaggle's terms of service, we will not host the raw .csv data files in our public GitHub repository. Instead, we will provide direct links to the Kaggle dataset pages and include our data acquisition scripts (e.g., Python scripts using the Kaggle API or manual download instructions) so that any third party can reproducibly acquire the same data. 


When handling data about real individuals, even public figures, we must consider the ethical implications. Although player salaries and performance statistics are public information, our analysis aggregates this data in ways that could be misinterpreted to pass judgment on a player's value. The primary risk is that our findings could be used to label specific players as "overpaid" or "underpaid," a conclusion that is both negative and reductionist given the inevitable limitations of any statistical model. To mitigate this, our project's goal is not to critique individual players but to identify statistical correlations between performance metrics and salary trends. All published analysis will focus on these aggregate trends, not the "worth" of players, and will include clear disclaimers about the model's limitations while avoiding subjective or inflammatory language. We must also consider the risk of misinterpretation, as it is connected to the potential for algorithmic and metric bias. Our research question relies on the assumption that the available metrics are fair and comprehensive. However, traditional box-score statistics like points and rebounds are known to favor offensive players over defensive specialists, and our analysis might reinforce existing biases in how player value is determined. We will explicitly document this as a potential source of bias and a limitation of our analysis.

We will primarily use CSV's and Files to facilitate Organization and Storage throughout our project. We will make sure to correclty name our files and clean our CSV's to create better readability
