Overview - The goal for our project is to design and implement a reproducable data management lifecycle. Our project will apply several modules and aspects of IS 477 on the game of Basketball, exploring the relationship between player performance and salaries in the NBA. 
Research Question - Is there a Correlation between Basketball Salary and Player Efficiency? Which Performance metrics are most predictive of a higher Salary?
Team - We will be splitting responsibilities my Module.
Michael Parinas - Lead work on Even Modules (Ethical Data Handling, Storage and Organization, Extraction and Enrichment, Data Integration, Data Cleaning, Workflow Automation and Provenance, Metadata and Data Documentation)
Richard Taing - Lead work on Odd Modules (Data Lifecycle, Data Collection and Acquisition, Storage and Organization, Data Integration, Data Quality, Workflow Automation and Provenance, Reproducibility and Transparency)
Both members will be supporting the lead to make sure each member has coverage on all modules.
Dataset 1 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratin21/nba-player-salaries-2000-2025. This Dataset contains NBA salaries from the Season 2000 to the Season 2025. Includes Player Name, Salary, and Season. This dataset will be used to  analyze salary trends. 
Dataset 2 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flynn28/historical-nba-player-stats-database/data This Dataset contains seasonal statistics for NBA players. Stats include points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and other performance stats. This dataset will be used to measure correlations between salaries.
