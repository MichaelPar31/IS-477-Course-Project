# Project Plan - NBA Salary and Performance Data Management

## Overview - 
The goal for our project is to design and implement a reproducable data management lifecycle. Our project will apply several modules and aspects of IS 477 on the game of Basketball, exploring the relationship between player performance and salaries in the NBA. Basketball has grown into a Sport that utilizes analytics and data for many different decisions. Our team will act as a Data Analyst for a NBA team, creating a structrued and repeateable workflow that will follow the FAIR principles. We will follow Data Management and Curation techniques and best practices to get the best results in our project. 

## Research Question - Is there a Correlation between Basketball Salary and Player Efficiency? Which Performance metrics are most predictive of a higher Salary? 
These questions are significant because it connects Data with real decisions NBA General Managers have to make everyday. Being able to understand which metrics are most important for higher salaries will allow Executives to craft the best team they can. The questions can be answered utilizing the correct datasets and data science techniques. 

## Team - We will be splitting responsibilities by Module.
Michael Parinas - Lead work on Even Modules (Ethical Data Handling, Storage and Organization, Extraction and Enrichment, Data Integration, Data Cleaning, Workflow Automation and Provenance, Metadata and Data Documentation)

Richard Taing - Lead work on Odd Modules (Data Lifecycle, Data Collection and Acquisition, Storage and Organization, Data Integration, Data Quality, Workflow Automation and Provenance, Reproducibility and Transparency)

Both members will be supporting the lead to make sure each member has coverage on all modules.

## Datasets - 
Dataset 1 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratin21/nba-player-salaries-2000-2025. This Dataset contains NBA salaries from the Season 2000 to the Season 2025. Includes Player Name, Salary, and Season. This dataset will be used to  analyze salary trends. This will serve as the foundation for our dependent variable of Salary. We will evaluate the dataset's ethical and legal compliance, also making sure it follows FAIR principles. Any concerns or gaps will be documented.

Dataset 2 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flynn28/historical-nba-player-stats-database/data This Dataset contains seasonal statistics for NBA players. Stats include points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and other performance stats. This dataset will be used to measure correlations between salaries. These metrics will serve as the independent variable for our analysis. We will evaluate the dataset's ethical and legal compliance, also making sure it follows FAIR principles. Any concerns or gaps will be documented.

## Timeline - Our Project will span the final weeks of the class. (6 - 7 Weeks)

Week 1 - Finalize research questions, confirm datasets, initial dataset inspection to identify key variables. Create script to acquire data and check integrity, along with documentation. (Both)

Week 2 - Identify Ethical, Legal, and Policy constraints. Select and describe a specific storage and organization strategy. Create Script to load data into a relational database, along with documentation. (Michael)

Week 3 - Extraction and Enrichment and Data Integration. Create scripts used to integrate datasets. Create models, along with documentation. (Richard)

Week 4 - Document data quality and Clean Data. Create scripts use to profile and clean data, along with documentation. Scripts used to create regression analysis and find correlation. Create visualizations, along with documentation. (Michael)

Week 5 - Workflow automation and Provenance. Document describing how to repeat our project. (Richard)

Week 6 - Reproducibility and Transparency and Metadata and Data Documentation. (Both)
